# Wordle Game

The goal is to guess the hidden five-letter word in five or fever attempts.

## Rules

- You have five attempts to guess the correct word.
- Each guess must be a valid five-letter word.
- After each guess, the game provides feedback by coloring the letters of your guessed word:
  - Green: The letter is in the correct position.
  - Yellow: The letter is in the word but in the wrong position.
  - Gray: The letter is not in the word at all.
- If a word contains repeated letters, each instance of the letter is evaluated separately based on its position in the word.
- Only words from the game's word list are considered valid guesses.
- You win if you guess the correct word within five attempts.
- You lose if you fail to guess the word within five attempts. The correct word is then revealed.
- There is only one Wordle puzzle per day, which is the same for all players worldwide.
- There are no hints or clues given apart from the color-coded feedback on each guess.
- The game is not case-sensitive; uppercase and lowercase letters are treated the same.
